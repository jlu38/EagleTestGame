# Eagle Test Game
This project was inspired by a color test game. The player is given a set of
colored squares where all but one color is the same, and they must then select the different
color. The squares' colors will change when the player selects the different colored square and the 
player earns 1 point added to their score. There is a 60 second time limit to select as many 
different colored squares as you can.
